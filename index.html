        <h4>I'm available for freelance work. Planning a new project or interested in working with me? That's awesome! Let's talk!</h4>
        <p>Our task was to create a web application which helps clients to get their own dedicated partner marketer, who stays up late, manages their team and ensures their business growth. We wanted this application to be modern, unique, fresh, easy to manage and interesting for users! So, let's see how we brought all these ideas to life! We decided to create unique characters for this project. All of them were drawn by our designers.</p>
